  Each packaging component has different properties to specify how many there are, its shape, material etc.

  The shape, material and recycling properties are mapped to one entry in the packaging_shapes, packaging_materials and packaging_recycling taxonomies, and the value of the property is the canonical name of the taxonomy entry (e.g. en:bottle).

  They may contain values that could not yet get matched to their respective taxonomy, in which case they will contain a free text value prefixed with the language code of this text value (e.g. "fr:Bouteille sph√©rique" might have been entered by a French user to indicate it is a spherical bottle).
