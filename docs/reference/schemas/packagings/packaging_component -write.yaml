  Each packaging component has different properties to specify how many there are, its shape, material etc.

  The shape, material and recycling properties will be mapped to one entry in the packaging_shapes, packaging_materials and packaging_recycling taxonomies.

  For input, clients can either pass the id of a corresponding taxonomy entry (e.g. "en:pizza-box"), or a free text value prefixed with the language code of the text (e.g. "en:Pizza box", "fr:boite à pizza"). If the language code prefix is missing, the value of the "lc" field of the query will be used.

  The resulting structure will contain the id of the canonical entry in the taxonomy if it good be matched, or the free text value prefixed with the language code otherwise.
