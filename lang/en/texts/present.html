      Presentations&nbsp;<br><br>A first step to contribute to Open Food Facts is to present it to you friends and family.<br>You can get on Twitter, Facebook or Google Plus and ask a few friends and family to join the project.<br><br>200 00 contributors have added 650 000 products on Open Food Facts. The database includes products from more than 100 different countries, but the bulk of them comes from France - where Open Food Facts was launched in 2012 - and from a few countries like Spain, the UK, the US and Belgium where we have some very motivated contributors. We need to change that: we need to add products from your country and try to reach a critical mass of products. Of even greater importance, <strong>We need to create and develop strong local communities of contributors</strong>.<br><br>To create this community, we need people who can present Open Food Facts in front of as many different audiences as possible, from the most obvious ones to the most unlikely. In France we have accepted all invitations to present our project, and each time we have quickly connected to the people who attended our presentations. Food is a universal topic of interest that everyone relates to. Explaining how we can better understand labels and easily compare products always generates a lot of interest and enthusiasm.<br><br><strong>So could you present Open Food Facts in your country?</strong><br><br>Here are some ideas of possible venues and audiences, but you will surely have other ones:<br>
